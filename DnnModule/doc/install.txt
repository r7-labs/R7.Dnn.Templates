==  Some additional steps to do:

1) Update reference to DotNetNuke.dll and other referenced assemblies to a "~\bin" folder (if needed).
   Template assumes that project is created in "~\DesktopModules" folder 
   *without* parent solution folder, so "..\..\bin\" path is used for references.
  
2) Set project build output path to DNN "~\bin" folder in project options.
   It can be "..\..\bin" for the case, described above.
   
3) You may want to disable automatic updates of CodeBehind partial classes in project options
   under ASP.NET page - it's not working correctly with third-party controls anyway.

4) Run 01.00.00.SqlDataProvider as script under Host -> SQL on DNN site.

5) Create new module under Host > Extensions from Manifest (.dnn) file.
