==  Some additional steps to do:

1) Update reference to DotNetNuke.dll and other referenced assemblies to a DNN "bin" folder - if needed.

   Template assumes that project is created in DNN "DesktopModules" folder with a parent solution folder 
   (same name as project's), so "..\..\..\bin" path is used to reference assemblies in DNN "bin" folder.

2) Set project build output path to DNN "bin" folder in the project options.
   It can be "..\..\..\bin" for the case, described above.
   
3) Build solution. Then you done with this, DnnModule.dll is located in a DNN "bin" folder.

   You may want to disable automatic updates of CodeBehind partial classes in project options
   under "ASP.NET" page. Automatic updates is not working correctly with third-party controls 
   in the MonoDevelop / Xamarin Studio anyway. This is true at least for version 4.2.3.

4) Go to the project directory, locate and run Package.cmd script. 

   This script automatically creates DnnModule-01.00.00-Install.zip package 
   in a solution folder (just go up in file manager). This script uses 7Zip 
   to create packages. And remember - you should build your project first!

5) Install module package as usual, from Host > Extensions.
